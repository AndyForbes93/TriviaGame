# TriviaGame

This is a short Trivia Game where you can test your hockey Knowledge!

Rules:
-Hit the start quiz button
-Click on the answer you think is correct
-At the end of the quiz you can see how many questions you got correct
- If you want to try again just hit the restart button


For some reason I cant get the restart button to show up reliably. theres a strange bug somewhere that makes it show up like 50% of the time. I also couldnt
     get a transition page to show up between each question without complely nuking the project so i gave up on that. other than that I feel that the quiz works fine.
